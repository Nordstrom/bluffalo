# Contributing

First: Thank you for considering making a contribution!  We're glad this project has been valuable to you.

We try to make contributing simple.  We believe code should be tested.

You can run the XCTest suite from Xcode. Please make sure all tests pass and any new functionality is covered by new tests. If you have any trouble, make a pull request with comments and we will try and respond as soon as we can.

Thanks again for considering a contribution, we hope to be reviewing your code soon!
